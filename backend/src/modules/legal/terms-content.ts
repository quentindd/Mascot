  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance</h2>
  <p>By signing in to or using Mascot (the “Plugin”), you agree to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the Plugin. Mascot is a third-party plugin for Figma; use of Figma is subject to Figma’s terms and policies.</p>

  <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
  <p>Mascot is a Figma plugin that lets you create and manage AI-generated mascots, poses, and animations. The service is provided on a credit-based model: certain actions consume credits, and you may purchase additional credit packs.</p>

  <h2>3. Account and Eligibility</h2>
  <p>You must create an account (e.g. via “Continue with Figma” or email) to use the Plugin. You are responsible for keeping your credentials secure and for all activity under your account. You must be at least 16 years old (or the age of consent in your country) to use the service.</p>

  <h2>4. Credits and Payments</h2>
  <p>New users receive an initial allocation of credits. Additional credits can be purchased through the Plugin; payments are processed by Stripe. All fees are in USD. Purchased credits are non-refundable except where required by law. We may change credit costs or pack prices with reasonable notice.</p>

  <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
  <p>You agree not to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Plugin for any illegal purpose or in violation of any applicable laws.</li>
    <li>Generate or upload content that infringes others’ intellectual property or that is defamatory, harmful, or otherwise objectionable.</li>
    <li>Resell, redistribute, or commercially exploit the Plugin or its outputs beyond normal use within your own designs.</li>
    <li>Attempt to circumvent credit checks, abuse the service, or use automated means to access the API beyond intended use.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these rules.</p>

  <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>You retain ownership of content you create and upload. By using the Plugin, you grant us the rights necessary to operate the service (e.g. to process and store your inputs and to generate outputs). AI-generated outputs are provided for your use within the Plugin and your designs; we do not claim ownership of your final designs.</p>

  <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
  <p>The Plugin and its outputs are provided “as is.” We do not guarantee that generated content will be error-free, non-infringing, or suitable for any particular use. You are responsible for reviewing and using outputs appropriately.</p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Plugin or purchased credits. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months preceding the claim.</p>

  <h2>9. Termination</h2>
  <p>We may suspend or terminate your access at any time for breach of these Terms or for operational reasons. You may stop using the Plugin at any time. Upon termination, your right to use the service ceases; provisions that by their nature should survive (e.g. liability, dispute resolution) remain in effect.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the Plugin after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. We will indicate the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.</p>

  <h2>11. Governing Law and Contact</h2>
  <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of France. For any questions or claims, contact us at the email address provided in the Plugin or on our service documentation.</p>
